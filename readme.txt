Allow any page to redirect somewhere, logging the IP and timestamp of each
visit.

== Description ==

Redirect and Log is a straightforward, no nonsense way to track visits to
a page, then to send a visitor somewhere else.

A new meta box will be added to the edit post page. If the value is not empty,
visitors will be redirected to the new location, and their IP address will
be logged in a simple custom table. That's it! No bells or whistles.

== Installation ==

Place all the files in a directory inside of wp-content/plugins (for example,
redirect-and-log), and activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I choose the URL to redirect to? =

Each page will have a meta box added. You can enter your URL there. Blank
URLs will result in no behaviour.

== Screenshots ==

1. A new post, and the meta box down below.
2. Just the meta box. Short and sweet.
3. A sample table in the database to show what type of data we're storing.
