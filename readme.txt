Allow any page to redirect somewhere, logging the IP and timestamp of each
visit.

Redirect and Log is a straightforward, no nonsense way to track visits to
a page, then to send a visitor somewhere else.

== Installation ==

Place all the files in a directory inside of wp-content/plugins (for example,
redirect-and-log), and activate the plugin.

You can find the admin page under Settings, titled Redirect and Log.
